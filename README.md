# CS506 Final Project

1. Project Description:
This project focuses on whether Major League Baseball teams are more successful if they spend more money on player salaries than other teams. By
analyzing historical financial records, win-loss records, and division/playoff performances, this project aims to identify correlations and patterns
between money and sports success. 

2. Goal:
My goals for this project are:
- To determine if teams have a higher chances of making the playoffs if they spend more money.
- To determine if there's a correlation between winning the division and teams spending more money.
- To determine if there's a correlation between winning the World Series and teams spending more money.

3. Data Collection:
For this, I would need to collect data by:
- Scraping from websites like Spotrac in order to get every teams amount of money spent each year.
- Scraping off of Pro Baseball Reference in order to get their record, division placement, and performance each year in the playoffs.

The data will be scraped and downloaded into CSV files for analysis.

4. Modeling:
To model the data, I will use linear models to display teams payroll and team record per year. I will also use clustering to display
teams with similar payroll, winning percentage, and playoff success. I may potentially explore using decision trees for outcomes such as
division standing and playoff appearance.

5. Visualization:
I plan on using scatterplots to display my data, plotting the total money spent versus the number of wins each year. I may try and use
an interactive plot team performance relative to their payroll over time. 

6. Test Plan:
My goal is to train roughly 10 years of data collected in October, before moving onto more years of data later in November. The testing on
the data will happen starting in November and then carry into December.
